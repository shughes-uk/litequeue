to-do list for oQueue
--

-  personal rank: dmg-rank and heal-rank; 1-100 position for both sides per bg
-  personal rank: ui element the user would leave up that would show their current dmg or heal rank
-  stats: record results of each game
-  game stats; raid leader should track bg members, both factions, and results
-  hero identified; using previous game info, raid leader should be able to identify the strong players
-  setup profiles for different bgs
-  (possible) allow leader to change a group into a raid w/ assist-on-all to allow members to invite ppl in their realm (helps ppl w/out b-net)
-  disable comms while in an instance (similar to being in a bg)
-  on logout, attempts to remove player from any premade waitlists 
-  put current honor and conquest pts on main premade tab
-  clear out the BG blacklist, putting up a note when it happens
-  add weekly winners to score tab

-  thumbs-down option for a premade.  would send thumbs-down msg to user, no more frequent then every 2 minutes.  
-  100 thumbs-dn recv'd, disbands the group
-  sub category for spec on waitlist to help determine what type of dps/tank/heal
-  inspect resil, ilevel, mmr and pvppower for all players when entering a bg.  if not qualified, offer leader chance to report to oqsk
-  if waitlisting with a group, collect min values for qualifying traits
-  bg timer bars
-  leader score should be based on the premade type; having 1000 bg victories doesnt mean the same as 1000 rbg wins or 1000 heroic runs
-  colorblind update: possibly allow users to select class colors via selector; http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12513-ClassColors.html
-  stats: personal and as lead
-  personal stats; 7-day running stats; # games, # kbs, honor gained, avg dmg per game, avg heal per game

-  list of pve achieves for a pve group
-  cmdline: disband
-  change notes into single line for vent and single line for notes
-  submit daily stat info to scorekeeper 
-  free-for-all needs to be selectable
-  dropdown to filter premades by language (requires language selector in create-premade)
-  tab for the last N people in the players group.  should be able to place in a permanant list or ban them, both with notes (thx smokebomb!)

- submitted via b-tag, oQ demographics? usage?
- /oq reset won't reset stats

-  announce when someone leaves the party
-  ref:  http://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-general/226258-ulduar-boss-sound-scripts.html
-  allow leave-queue to be 30sec, 60sec, and no-boot
-  warn the OQ leader if someone is flagged as brb (allow for queue-anyway)
-  add 'reach' to setup panel (bit-string representing all realms)
-  poll; allow raid leader to specify up to 4 items and have members vote.  bar graph display visible to all
-  break timer
-  option under keybindings to allow user to bind a key to toggle the main oq ui

from andybro-requiem
